## ✨ How We Built This

1. **Started with the HTML structure**
  - We set up the basic layout: a search bar, city name display, weather icon, temperature, description, and extra details.

3. **Styling with CSS**
  - We aimed for a modern layout,  spacing, colors, and clear design, ensuring the app functions properly.

5. **Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API**
   - We used JavaScript's 'fetch()' with an API Key, integrating the data from the weather data from OpenWeatherMap API into the code.
   - When a user enters a city, the app sends a request to the API.
   - The API responds with JSON data for temperature, weather stauses, and time.
     
6. **Updated the UI using JavaScript**
   - Extracted the JSON fields we needed.
   - Displayed the weather data directly in the HTML.
   - The app shows a weather icon that changes based on weather conditions.
     
7. **Error handling**

   If the user types an invalid city name, an error message appears, rather than breaking the app.

9. **Final polish**

   We tested multiple cities, adjusted spacing, added a favicon, and made the design visually appealing.
